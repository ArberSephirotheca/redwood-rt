## Dataset generators

* Uniform random 

* Fisher's Iris dataset: This dataset contains measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of 150 iris flowers from three different species. The goal is to predict the species of the flower based on the measurements. This dataset has only four dimensions and is a popular dataset for classification problems.

* Wine dataset: This dataset contains measurements of different chemical properties of wines from three different cultivars. The goal is to predict the cultivar based on the measurements. This dataset has 13 dimensions, which is still considered relatively low, and is a popular dataset for classification problems.
